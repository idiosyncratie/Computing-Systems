Stack   Content             Description
0x1004  3                   First argument for fact
0x1000  return address      the caller's return address. When the function is
                            called, a return address is pushed
0xFFFC  base pointer        caller's base pointer
0xFFF8  2                   pushes 3-1 for recursive call 
                            and is the argument for the next call

0xFFF4  0x2030              call fact_resume, acts as a return address
0xFFF0  0xFFFC              push the old base pointer
                            this is the new base pointer of the first level
0xFFEC  1                   push 2 - 1 for recursive call
                            and is the argument for the next call

0xFFE8  0x2030              call fact_resume,  acts as a return address
0xFFE4  0xFFF0              push the old base pointer
                            this is the new base pointer of the second level
0xFFE0  0                   push 1 - 1 for recursive call
                            and is the argument for the next call

0xFFDC  0x2030              call fact_resume, acts as a return address
0xFFD8  0xFFE4              push the old base pointer
                            this is the new base pointer of the third level
