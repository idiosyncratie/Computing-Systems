a) cache-timing equations 
x = number of cache misses
y = number of successes
101*x + y = 3,000,000,000
x + y = 750,000,000 

x = 22,500,000
The miss rate is 3%


b) To double performance we want twice the number of instructions per second
x = number of cache misses
y = number of successes
101*x + y = 3,000,000,000
x + y = 1,500,000,000 
x = 15,000,000
 The new miss rate is 1%, so the miss rate needs to be reduced
 by 2%.
